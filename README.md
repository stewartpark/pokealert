# PokeAlert

UPDATE: Changed our source of pulling from Pokevision to Skiplagged. This bot still works!

Know when pokemon are around on Slack! PokeAlert posts a message on Slack when pokemon appear near you real-time! It **had to be** written in Go, because it's Pokemon **Go**. :joy:

## How it works

~~There's a well-known definitely-most-awesome magical website called Pokevision, which did an awesome job on pulling data of the locations of pokemon. PokeAlert uses the API of theirs. Think of this as a Pokevision integration. (Unofficial, but their API was nice and easy enough to use... Contact me if you don't want this, Pokevision guys)~~

Sadly, Pokevision went down. So, we changed our pulling source to Skiplagged's pokevision service! Thanks Skiplagged for the awesome service!
