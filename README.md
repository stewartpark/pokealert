# PokeAlert

Know when pokemon are around on Slack! PokeAlert posts a message on Slack when pokemon appear near you real-time! It **had to be** written in Go, because it's Pokemon **Go**. :joy:

## How it works

There's a well-known definitely-most-awesome magical website called Pokevision, which did an awesome job on pulling data of the locations of pokemon. PokeAlert uses the API of theirs. (Unofficial, but their API was nice and easy enough to use... Contact me if you don't want this, Pokevision guys)
